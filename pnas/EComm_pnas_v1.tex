\section{Mathematical Definition of the Economic Complexity Index}
\label{sec:ECIdefinition}
The calculation of the ECI starts from the matrix of countries (rows) and the products (columns) they export, $\mtx{M}$. Let this matrix have size $C\times P$. This is a matrix that has been discretized so that $M_{c,p}$ is 1 if the product $p$ is exported in country $c$, and 0 otherwise. From this matrix, one creates two stochastic matrices. First, the right-stochastic (i.e., row-stochastic or row-normalized) transition matrix of ``countries to products'', $$\mtx{R}=\diag{1/\vec{d}}\cdot\mtx{M},$$ and second, the left-stochastic (i.e., column-stochastic or column-normalized) transition matrix of ``products to countries'', $$\mtx{L}=\mtx{M}\cdot\diag{1/\vec{u}},$$ where $\vec{d}=\mtx{M}\cdot\vec{1}$ is the vector that contains the number of products a country exports (i.e., its \emph{diversity}) and where $\vec{u}=\mtx{M}^T\cdot\vec{1}$ is the vector that contains the number of countries from which the product is exported (i.e., its \emph{ubiquity}). We use the notation $\diag{\vec{x}}$ to mean the matrix whose diagonal is the vector $\vec{x}$ and the other values are zero, and $\vec{1}$ to denote a vector of 1's.

Four important characteristics of left-stochastic matrices are worth mentioning, as they will be useful below:\footnote{These properties also hold for right-stochastic matrices, by simply swapping the words ``right'' and ``left''.} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A stochastic matrix for discrete markov chain can be represented as a network of nodes connected through directed edges. 
    \item Multiplying on the right of the matrix is the way of \emph{propagating probabilities} through the network of connected nodes. 
    \item Multiplying on the left of the matrix is the way of \emph{averaging some node-specific property} conditioned on standing on each of the nodes and only observing the nodes to which probabilities propagate to.
\end{enumerate}


Let us construct the left-stochastic transition probability matrix of ``countries to countries'', $$\mtx{C}=\mtx{L}\cdot\mtx{R}.$$ For mathematical convenience, we will assume that the stochastic matrix $\mtx{C}$ is irreducible and aperiodic. 

Now, let $\vec{l_i}^T$ and $\vec{r_i}$ be the $i$th left-eigenvector and right-eigenvector, respectively, so that the eigenvalues are ordered in decreasing value, $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq\cdots\geq \lambda_C$. The list of ECIs for countries is defined as the left sub-dominant eigenvector, $\vec{ECI}^T\equiv \vec{l_2}^T$:
\begin{align}
	\vec{ECI}^T\cdot \mtx{C}=\lambda_2 \vec{ECI}^T.
\label{eqn:drag}
\end{align}


It is easy to prove that the vector $\vec{d}$ of the diversity of countries is orthogonal to the vector of ECIs, $\vec{ECI}$, once you realize that $\vec{d}$ is actually the dominant right-eigenvector (sometimes referred to as the ``perron'' eigenvector, or just simply, the stationary distribution of the discrete markov chain defined by $\mtx{C}$). Thus, multiplying $\vec{d}$ on the right of $\mtx{C}$, and expanding $\mtx{C}$ into its components,
\begin{align}
    \mtx{C}\cdot\vec{d} &= (\mtx{L}\cdot\mtx{R}^T)\cdot\vec{d}, \nonumber \\
    &= (\mtx{M}\cdot\diag{1/\vec{u}})\cdot(\diag{1/\vec{d}}\cdot\mtx{M})^T\cdot\vec{d}, \nonumber \\
    &= (\mtx{M}\cdot\diag{1/\vec{u}})\cdot(\mtx{M}^T\diag{1/\vec{d}})\cdot\vec{d}, \nonumber \\
    &= (\mtx{M}\cdot\diag{1/\vec{u}})\cdot\mtx{M}^T\cdot\vec{1}, \nonumber \\
    &= (\mtx{M}\cdot\diag{1/\vec{u}})\cdot\vec{u}, \nonumber \\
    &= \mtx{M}\cdot\vec{1}, \nonumber \\
    &= \vec{d}.
\end{align}
Thus, $\vec{d}$ is a right-eigenvector of $\mtx{C}$ associated with the eigenvalue $\lambda_1=1$, which from the Perron-Frobenius theorem one concludes that $\vec{d}$ is the \emph{dominant} right-eigenvector. This means, given classical results from discrete markov chains, that the stationary distribution of the stochastic process defined by $\mtx{C}$ is ${\boldsymbol \pi} = \vec{d}/\sum_c d_c$. Therefore, since left-eigenvectors are orthogonal to right-eigenvectors, $\vec{l_i}^T \cdot \vec{r_j}=\delta_{i,j}$ (assuming eigenvectors have norm one), we conclude that $$\vec{ECI}^T\cdot\vec{d}=0,$$ which is a result that had been noted before already in reference \cite{eric2014}.

All these results apply to the product space matrix as well, $\mtx{P} = \mtx{R}^T\cdot \mtx{L}$. Namely, the sub-dominant left-eigenvector is the list of product complexity indices, PCIs, and the dominant right-eigenvector is proportional to the list of ubiquities.

One of the ways the economic complexity index has been defined is by postulating that products have a complexity, and that the complexity of countries is the average complexity of the products it exports. Conversely, one defines the complexity of the products as the average complexity of the countries where it is exported. It is claimed that this uniquely defines these two vectors. This is false, to the extent that any of the left-eigenvectors of the matrices $\mtx{C}$ and $\mtx{P}$ have this property. To show it, recall that $\vec{l_i}^T$ and $\vec{r_i}$ are the $i$th left-eigenvector and right-eigenvector of $\mtx{C}$, respectively, and assume denote now $\vec{q_i}^T$ and $\vec{s_i}$ be the $i$th left-eigenvector and right-eigenvector, respectively, of $\mtx{P}$. First, note that
\begin{align}
    \mtx{C}\cdot\mtx{L} &= \left(\mtx{L}\mtx{R}^T\right)\cdot\mtx{L}, \nonumber \\
    &= \mtx{L}\cdot\left(\mtx{R}^T\mtx{L}\right), \nonumber \\
    &= \mtx{L}\cdot \mtx{P}.
\label{eq:CReqRP}
\end{align}
And second, start from the fact that $\lambda_i \vec{l_i}^T = \vec{l_i}^T\cdot \mtx{C}$, and multiply it on the right by the matrix $\mtx{L}$, and then use Eq.~(\ref{eq:CReqRP}):
\begin{align}
    \left(\lambda_i \vec{l_i}^T\right)\cdot\mtx{L}&=\left(\vec{l_i}^T\cdot \mtx{C}\right)\cdot\mtx{L}, \nonumber \\
    \lambda_i \left(\vec{l_i}^T\cdot\mtx{L}\right)&= \vec{l_i}^T\cdot \left(\mtx{C}\cdot\mtx{L}\right), \nonumber \\
    &= \vec{l_i}^T\cdot \left(\mtx{L}\cdot \mtx{P}\right), \nonumber \\
    &= \left(\vec{l_i}^T\cdot \mtx{L}\right)\cdot \mtx{P}, \label{eq:averageonaverage}
\end{align}
which can be re-written as
\begin{align}
    \lambda_i \vec{q_i}^T &= \vec{q_i}^T\cdot \mtx{P}. \label{eq:eigenvecofP}
\end{align}
It is easy to see from Equations~(\ref{eq:averageonaverage}) and (\ref{eq:eigenvecofP}) that if $\vec{l_i}^T$ is a left-eigenvector of $\mtx{C}$, then the vector $\vec{l_i}^T\cdot \mtx{L}$ is the $i$th left-eigenvector of $\mtx{P}\odot$, such that $\vec{q_i}^T = \vec{l_i}^T\cdot \mtx{L}$. Furthermore, you demonstrate that the eigenvalues of both matrices are the same.\footnote{Moreover, since $\mtx{M}$ is typically not square, and there are more products than countries, $P>C$, this results also indicates that the matrix $\mtx{P}$ has some degenerate eigenvalues, which in turn explains why in the calculation of the PCIs one observes many identical values.} This result, obviously, applies to the sub-dominant eigenvectors of both matrices, which are the complexity indices. But the point is that if we use the definition of complexities based on the averages, one has to choose among $\min\{C,P\}$ choices.


Now, the values of ECI have been shown to be positively associated with income levels and income growth of countries \cite{Hidalgo_2009}. However, a clear and direct interpretation of the physical meaning of ECI, as the sub-dominant left-eigenvector, and its association with a measure of collective know-how, and its link to economic growth, has been lacking. The reason for this confusion is born out, first, from its flawed interpretation as a linear measure to rank countries, and second, as that interpretation that states that it is that quantity which is the average property of products.

In the next section, we clarify these issues, and we show why it is that ECI is, in fact, a good indicator of the size of the collective know-how of countries. The argument is, however, both obvious and non-trivial. Obvious precisely because of its interpretation as the sub-dominant left-eigenvector, but non-trivial, from the ultimate significance about the emphasis it gives to the underlying process of economic development as a process of collective learning.
