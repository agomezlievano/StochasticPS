This paper, concentrating on Southeast Asian countries, examines the extent and variation of discrepancy in export and import recordings of their own and of their trading partners. The ratio of corresponding trade records exhibit varying heights and irregular patterns suggesting a larger degree of inaccuracy than generally assumed. Inter-Asian trade of Southeast Asian countries show a greater discrepancy than that of their trade with developed countries, and the trade ratio variance of the former is significantly larger than that of the latter at the 5\% level. The rank coefficient of correlation between the level of discrepancy and the absolute size of trade value is found to be insignificant for most countries. Also the adjustment of trade figures by exchange rate overvaluation does not narrow the inconsistency in the bilateral trade recordings. The recordings of commodity-by-country trade data show a larger discrepancy than that of total trade.},

The results show that major discrepancies often exist between the two, with false invoicing and smuggling apparently responsible for much of the difference. Although major disparities exist in data on trade with developed countries, the average differences in intra-African trade statistics are substantially larger. Statistical tests show that these data cannot be relied on to indicate the level, composition, or even direction and trends in African trade.},

	abstract = {Previous investigations which evaluated the accuracy of trade statistics were generally based on the partner country approach, i.e., a given country's reported exports (imports) were compared with a partner's reported imports (exports) with the objective of identifying major value differences and the reasons for these discrepancies. The present study employs a new methodology that focuses on the internal consistency of trade statistics. Four key questions are addressed: (1) are the data reported under different classification schemes (like {SITC} Revision 1 and 2) consistent at points where there are perfect correspondences between product groups: (2) are trade totals consistent with the sum of values reported for lower level products; (3) is total trade consistent with the sum of trade reported with individual partner countries; and (4) are trade values compiled by one reporting organization (United Nations) consistent with those of an alternative ({IMF}) agency. By performing these consistency tests annually from the early 1960s this study is able to assess trends in the reliability of trade data. The tests results should be extremely disquieting for data users. Differences of 100 percent (or more) are observed in some countries' (supposedly directly comparable) {SITC} Revision 1 and 2 trade totals with the average discrepancy for all developing countries' exports exceeding 60 percent in the early 1980s. Second, total trade figures are frequently found to be inconsistent with trade data for component products (i.e., the sum of trade in (say) three- or four-digit {SITC} products is often considerably more, or less, than a country;s reported trade) and such discrepancies persist in some country's data for more than 20 years. Third, there has been a clear deterioration in reporting the origin or destination of trade since 1980 as over 30 percent of developing countries' imports or exports are not properly allocated. Fourth, different international agencies sometimes report trade values for specific countries that differ by 100 percent or more. Such discrepancies appear especially important for the least developed countries, but there is evidence that the differences for all countries widened over the last decade.},

We calculated export over- and underestimation for each country and all of their bilateral trading partners. By keeping totals for over- and underestimation in separate categories we avoided the cancellation effect of aggregating positive and negative discrepancies among partner countries. In general, the results show a significant improvement in the quality of trade data over time. However for many countries, relatively large discrepancies still exist that defy technical explanations, such as the {CIF}-{FOB} margins. Also, because export over- and underestimation coexist for most of the countries at varying degrees, use of the aggregate sum of the discrepancy might disguise the actual magnitude of the problem. A significant difference exists in the relative magnitude and dispersion of trade discrepancies between {OECD} countries and non-{OECD} countries. Trend analysis suggests that the accuracy of trade data is improving at a faster rate in the non-{OECD} than in the {OECD} countries.},

Comparisons of detailed customs records from China, Hong, Kong, and the United States show that direct exports from Chinese ports and Chinese exports through third countries account for much of the discrepancy, relative to trade flows involving Hong Kong. Transshipment and re-exports through Hong Kong seem no longer to be the major explanation of the discrepancies, especially in recent years. Adjustment for a likely double-counting between re-exports and transshipments make the estimated discrepancy for 2005 increase to \$59 billion.},

	abstract = {This paper documents the construction of {BACI}, our international trade database, which covers more than 200 countries and 5,000 products, between 1994 and 2007. New approaches have been developed to reconcile data reported by almost 150 countries to the United Nations Statistics Division, collated via {COMTRADE}. When both exporting and importing countries report to Comtrade, we have two different figures for the same flow, so it is useful to reconcile these into a single figure. To do this, firstly, as import values are reported {CIF} (cost, insurance and freight) while exports are reported {FOB} (free on board), transport and insurance rates have to be estimated and removed from import values. We regress the observed {CIF}/{FOB} ratios for a given flow on gravity variables and a product-specific world median unit value. In a second step we evaluate the reliability of countries reporting. We decompose the absolute value of the ratios of mirror flows using a (weighted) variance analysis. These measures of the reliability of reported data are used as weights in the reconciliation of each bilateral trade flow which is reported twice. Taking advantage of this bilateral information on each flow, we end up with a large coverage of countries and more reliable data, especially in terms of unit-values. {BACI} is freely available online to users of {COMTRADE} database, in different product classifications.},

This discrepancy, which is not caused by re-exporting through Hong Kong, varies by product categories, and in some cases takes the opposite sign. In this paper, we focus on China's direct exports to the United States. Using a model that allows for simultaneous misreporting to two authorities, we find strong statistical evidence of under-reporting exports at the Chinese border to avoid paying value-added tax ({VAT}). The value of {VAT} avoided is estimated at \$6.5 billion during 2002–2008, and the associated understatements account for approximately two-thirds of the discrepancy. We also provide evidence of tariff evasion at the U.S. border, in particular for related-party transactions, and indirect evidence of transfer pricing and evasion of Chinese capital controls. An estimated \$2 billion of U.S. tariff revenue is lost due to such evasion during 2002–2008, which reduces the apparent size of the statistical discrepancy.},
